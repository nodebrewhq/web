## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Cool gray (#808080), inspired by the Nodebrew logo, offering a neutral and sophisticated feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), a heavily desaturated version of the primary, for a clean and minimalist backdrop.
- Accent color: Slightly darker cool gray (#696969), analogous to the primary, providing subtle contrast for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern, objective look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist icons, possibly line icons, to represent different sections and interactive elements. Ensure icons are consistent with the overall clean and modern design.
- Maintain a clean and minimalist layout with ample whitespace to enhance readability and focus. Utilize a grid system for consistent alignment and responsiveness.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions, such as scrolling and accordion expansions, to enhance user experience without being distracting.
